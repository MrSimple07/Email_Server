## Introduction

Welcome to the administration manual for the Replica Email Server project. This manual provides step-by-step instructions for installing, configuring, and administering the email server replica using Python, SMTP, IMAP, and Streamlit on a Windows environment.

## System Requirements

Before installing the email server, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Windows (tested on Windows 10)
- **Software Dependencies**:
  - Python 3.x (preferably the latest stable version)
  - Python packages: `smtplib`, `imaplib`, `email`, `streamlit`
- **Hardware**: 
  - Minimum of 4GB RAM (recommended)
  - Sufficient disk space for storing emails and logs

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install Python

If Python is not already installed on your system, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions. Make sure to add Python to the system PATH during installation.

### Step 2: Install Required Python Packages

Open a command prompt and install the necessary Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install smtplib imaplib email streamlit
```

### Step 3: Download the Project Files

Download the project files containing the Python scripts for SMTP, IMAP functionality, and Streamlit user interface. You can clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrSimple07/Email_Server
```

### Step 4: Set Up Streamlit Environment
Navigate to the directory containing the Streamlit script (app.py) and run Streamlit to set up the user interface:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Configuration

### SMTP Configuration:
- Edit the SMTP script (`smtp_server.py`) to configure:
  - SMTP server address (`smtp_server = 'localhost'`)
  - Port number (`smtp_port = 25` by default)
  - Authentication details if required (username, password)

### IMAP Configuration:
- Edit the IMAP script (`imap_server.py`) to configure:
  - IMAP server address (`imap_server = 'localhost'`)
  - Port number (`imap_port = 143` by default)
  - Authentication details if required (username, password)

## Running the Email Server

To start the email server, follow these steps:

1. **Run SMTP Server**: Execute the SMTP server script (`smtp_server.py`) in the Python terminal:

   ```bash
   python smtp_server.py
   ```

2. **Run IMAP Server**: Execute the IMAP server script (`imap_server.py`).

   ```bash
   python imap_server.py
    ```
3. Run Streamlit Interface: Navigate to the directory containing the Streamlit script and run Streamlit.

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Managing User Accounts:
User accounts can be managed manually by editing the scripts or by integrating with a user database. Ensure proper security measures are in place for user authentication and authorization.

To manually manage user accounts, follow these steps:
- Open the user management script (`user_client.py`).
- Add, remove, or update user details within the script.
- Ensure user credentials are stored securely, avoiding plain text passwords. Use hashing algorithms like bcrypt for password storage.

## Troubleshooting:
- Check Logs: Monitor logs generated by the SMTP and IMAP servers for errors (smtp_logs.txt, imap_logs.txt).
- Verify Dependencies: Ensure all Python packages are installed correctly.
- Firewall Settings: Adjust firewall settings to allow incoming and outgoing connections on the specified ports (SMTP and IMAP ports).

## Security Considerations:

- Encryption: Implement SSL/TLS for secure email transmission (SMTPS, IMAPS).
- Authentication: Use strong passwords and implement authentication mechanisms.
- Access Control: Restrict access to administrative functions and sensitive data.
- Regular Updates: Keep Python and all installed packages up to date with security patches.

## Conclusion:
This concludes the administration and installation manual for the Replica Email Server project. By following these instructions, you should be able to set up, configure, and run the email server replica on a Windows system effectively.
